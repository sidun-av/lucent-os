# Make DXVK the Direct3D 8-11 implementation for every Wine prefix.
#
# Fedora's wine-dxvk %posttrans runs `vulkaninfo` and, when that fails (as
# it always does in an image build or container without a GPU), registers
# DXVK at alternatives priority 5, below wined3d's 10 - so DXVK is silently
# off on every machine built from such an image. This switches each
# wine-{d3d8,d3d9,d3d10core,d3d11,dxgi} alternative that has a DXVK
# candidate to it. Run as root after installing wine-dxvk*.
